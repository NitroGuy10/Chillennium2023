Heart2Heart is a game made for the 48-hour Chillennium 2023 Game Jam.
It was super fun to make and it won Best In Originality!

Heart2Heart is made in the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine and uses all homemade assets.
Except for one sprite of a lens flare.

Made by Naveen Iyer, Kat Nguyen, Anish Karthik, and Lizzy Yoon

The original game was made during the game jam, but I've been adding some extra fixes and new features!
You can play the most up-to-date version at the link above.
